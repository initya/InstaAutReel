1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,466
Okay, buckle up, because the

2
00:00:02,466 --> 00:00:04,933
universe is secretly hilarious and

3
00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:07,400
also possibly lying to us.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,720
Did you know, botanically speaking,

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,040
a banana is actually a

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,360
berry, but a strawberry isn't?

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,160
Mind blown!

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,760
My whole fruit salad

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,360
identity is a lie!

10
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,760
Speed speed should be 5x.

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,400
Record scratch.

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,672
And get this, Oxford University

13
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:27,945
is older than the Aztec

14
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:28,400
Empire.

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,440
Like, buy a lot.

16
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,640
Chimes.

17
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,560
So next time you're complaining

18
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,480
about ancient textbooks, just remember,

19
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,240
they've been there since before Cortez.

20
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,320
Probably still using the same Wi-Fi.

21
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,560
Speed speed should be 5x.

22
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,280
Oh, and here's a fun one.

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,480
It rains diamonds on Jupiter and Saturn.

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,960
Diamonds!

25
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,680
Sparkle sound.

26
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,800
Meanwhile, I'm just here paying rent.

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,000
What gives, cosmos?

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,600
Playful grumble.

29
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,540
Makes you wonder what else

30
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,480
they're not telling us, right?

31
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,280
Mystery music fades out.
